Welcome to my very first dev log! I'm excited to share the foundational elements I've been working on to bring this dynamic, living game world to life. Hereâ€™s a look at what I've created so far:

---

## Infinite Procedural World

I've designed a vast, endlessly expanding landscape that generates uniquely as you explore. You'll discover diverse biomes including grasslands, forests, mountains, and lakes. Every region you visit will be different, promising fresh adventures each time you set out.

---

## A Growing Village Community

At the heart of the game is a lively village filled with active villagers. These characters aren't simply idleâ€”they build homes, hunt wildlife, gather resources, and craft tools essential for survival. You'll watch them construct cozy teepees, maintain fire pits, and eventually farm the land, turning a simple campsite into a thriving community.

---

## Smart Villager AI

The villagers behave intelligently, managing their tasks based on both immediate needs and long-term goals. They prioritize critical tasks like gathering food when supplies run low, crafting spears for hunting, and researching new technologies. Each villager actively contributes to the community, making the village feel alive and authentic.

---

## Adventure and Danger

Venturing beyond the village is risky. Fierce wildlife, such as roaming tigers, pose serious threats to your villagers. They can hunt in groups, arm themselves for defense, or carefully avoid confrontation. Each encounter adds excitement and danger, ensuring every adventure is memorable.

---

## Special Player Abilities

As a player, you have powerful abilities, called **"miracles,"** which help guide and protect your villagers. You can ignite critical fires or trigger important events to influence the growth and direction of your village strategically.

---

## Engaging Visuals

I've implemented an appealing isometric visual style to enhance immersion. Controls allow intuitive interaction with villagers and objects, clearly highlighting your actions. The dynamic camera follows smoothly, keeping you involved in every unfolding story moment.
